Unit is ultrasonically welded - I first carefully worked a razor knife around the edge, but that wasn't enough.  I had to use a couple of small jewelers screwdrivers to get the back to separate the back.  Be careful, the main PCB spans the entire back, and is only 1/4"" away from the back cover. 
The microcontroller is on the small PCB attached to the front panel with 2 screws. 

There are clearly marked pads for 3v3, GND, TX, RX, GI0. 

(note: I am still able to successfully program OTA using tuya-convert 2.4.3 -- i.e. without opening it.)
